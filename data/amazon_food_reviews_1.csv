I compared this to some Belgian dark chocolate bars I had in the house and they contained no cholesterol at all.

If you are out hiking or somewhere else where water is available from a water fountain or stream (filter anything from a stream before drinking it) where you can get water along the way and add some flavor and vitamins with this product.  It will be lighter and easier than carrying bottles of some sort of sports drink with you.It tastes like Kool-Aid.  It's not delicious, not horrible, just sort of OK. There are, of course, a lot of other powdered and concentrated liquid mixes (similar to this one) that would serve the same purpose.  Nothing about this Vitamin Squeeze makes it stand out from anything else.  It has no calories which probably means it has chemicals instead of sugar.It is not something I'd be likely to purchase but if you need something more than water when you would otherwise have to either carry a lot of water weight or spend a couple bucks for each 16oz sports drink while out on the road this product may be more convenient and/or save you money.",3,Kool-Aid With Vitamins,1333756800

These things are sweet but not too sweet to face first thing in the morning, and they are awesome for dunking. You have to be careful though, they have a brittle texture that breaks easily, so if a piece falls into your cup it will dissolve before you can fish it out again.

It never did make a satisfactory flavored water, and even when I tried to use it to sweeten my hot tea, I was not pleased with the result.

Tastes really good.  The seasoning adds something that you wouldn't get just by adding hambuger to mac&cheese.;  And this is really good mac&cheese; as well.  Delivers a satisfying feeling of satiation without eating a large portion.  Real comfort food.Preperation is a snap.  After simmering 13 minutes it looked like there was too much water left over but by the time the food was served it had congealed enough not to be runny.If I were to try this again I'd use ground turkey instead of beef and less of it.  Maybe 12 oz instead of 16 and add a bit more mac to make up for it.  But if you want a satisfying, beefy meal you can't go wrong these Cheeseburger Skillets.Box says fat is 9g a serving, 3g of it saturated.  That would vary depending on what type of meat you added.  Sodium is 850g.  Highish but not unusual for this tupe of prepared meal.

I make a pitcher of tea or lemonade, but rarely both at once, it's just too hot. This Lipton instant Half & Half is pretty good. It's got that tart lemonade bite at the back of every sip, but leads with the soft, sweetness of good iced tea. It is a bit sweet if you follow the measurements on the can - at least for my tastes. But the beauty of a powder mix is you can adjust up or down until you find the perfect balance. The crystals dissolve very quickly when you stir it in and the flavor is good.

But I went ahead and gave it a shot because I'm trying to find a way to cut back on the amount of sugar I use in my beverages like coffee and tea. The first time I used the syrup I used a teaspoon in my cup of morning coffee in place of the usual sugar or flavored creamer I typically use.

Not a bad thing necessarily but just so you know.I got a seemingly giant, rectangular, pretty red tin with two trays filled with a lot of cookies (each tray has the same assortment).  There are two types of cookies that are predominantly white chocolate, with a third which is half-white and half-regular.  Then the rest are either dark or milk chocolate.  The cookies are what I would say is normal sized (i.e., for most people that would be two to four bites per cookie).  Inside the tin's lid is a chart describing each type and pointing out which ones have nuts, etc.These cookies seem to melt easily.  I took a chance on the end of the winter season in Florida, and they arrived sort of stuck together in their compartments, but generally I was able to break them apart.  Still I noticed that at room temperature they did get a little soft, such that they will easily leave chocolate on your fingers.  I just kept them in the refrigerator to get around that problem.I would say there are about 5-6 cookies of each type in its own compartment in the tray; so with two trays you are getting roughly a dozen of each type.  Some are much bigger than others, or thicker, so you get only 4 of that type.  But, it's a lot of cookies.I'm not really a tin collector, but I thought this really sturdy, pretty red tin was an added-value perk of this product.  It's a useful size for a lot of things and isn't covered with hokey illustrations like a lot of tins are.  Mine had a subtle textural patterning; unsure if they are all the same, as the photo on Amazon appears to show a tin that is shaped differently than the one I received.I would probably order these only occasionally, and during the cooler winter season, because they are so rich.  By the time we got to the end of the box, I experienced a sort of burn-out with them.",5,Good although in truth pretty repetitive in flavors,1398816000

The biggest problem with this variety pack is that it unashamedly promotes Krave above all the other cereals.Let me explain.I've already tried a regular box of Krave and found it way too sugary for my taste. Unfortunately this set includes 2 varieties of Krave, Milk Chocolate and Double Chocolate (as if the regular type wasn't enough to put me into a pre-diabetic coma). Out of a 24 gram pouch, for example, almost a third of it (9 grams) is made up of sugar. You read this right. A third.Not only is it overrepresented, but the pouches for Krave are BIGGER than any other pouches:Apple Jacks =.63 ozFruit Loops =.63 ozCorn Pops =.67 ozKRAVE double chocolate =.85 ozKRAVE milk chocolate=1 FULL oz.This is annoying. Kellogg is pushing this brand pretty hard and this variety pack is a promotional vehicle for it, hoping to entice consumers by bundling it up with much-loved favorites. I hate hard-sells. Instead of an extra set of Krave, Kellogg should have included its famous Corn Flakes, an obvious omission.On the positive side, these pouches are easier to store in the pantry though easier to crush than the buckets. The serving size is great for travel and for a kid's lunchbox.  However, for an adult's breakfast (and not as a snack), it is meager and one pouch is definitely not enough. I had to empty two pouches to equal my one adult serving. I've already gone through four pouches already, so you can bet these will not last long!Lastly, you are paying for convenience, not price, so it's not a great buy compared to buying a regular size box of Kellogg's cereal, measuring out one serving, and pouring it into a small ziploc bag. However, many parents don't have time to do this, so I guess this is the chief appeal of small packages like this.So overall, I would buy a Kellogg's variety pack again, but the bias toward Krave turned me off of this one.",4,"Variety Pack Promotes Krave, the Most Sugary Cereal of the Bunch",1385769600

They also have fractionated oil and a few other crappy things, but all in all this is at least relatively close to a healthy piece of food, by corporate standards at least. Of course anyone really serious about health will buy organic, but this is at least better than much of the pseudo-food coming out of the laboratories--sorry, ""kitchens""--of American mega-biz companies.I noticed the last time I gave a so-so rating to a food product that I wasn't offered any more for months on the Vine Program. I guess I was red-flagged for not drinking the kool-aid and for presenting an honest opinion. Nice to get another chance, and I will give Kraft props for presenting a semi-healthy health bar. But why not make it organic, folks? It's mostly grains and those are relatively cheap when organic, and SO much healthier than the Roundup-laden stuff that isn't organic.I'm loving that agribiz is scrambling to appear to care about America's health after feeding us carcinogens and maximum dumb-down swill for decades (look at our current situation...think the dumbing-down worked? Like a charm!). Well, they're starting to pull the HFCS from their crap, somewhat, so maybe our dollars really do speak. But in the meantime smart folks are buying organic and shopping for locally grown foods. How long before we stop agribiz from destroying all our topsoil with their toxic chemical-laden ""farming""? Better be soon, we're losing that soil mighty fast. Read up on it and learn some disturbing facts about what our idiot food choices have done to our soil and our family farmers--and are still doing. Every food dollar supports good local folks, if you spend it right.Only sustainable organic farming will turn our soil and our health around, so until then, all these ""health"" prodcuts with non-organic grains are just contributing to the destruction of our land and the few small farmers that agribiz hasn't yet crushed.

I add two teaspoons to iced tea, and if you don't smell it, I swear it tastes just like a lemon iced tea. Use it in coleslaw and salads; The possibilities are endless. Just don't use this vinegar when cooking food, because high heat kills all the beneficial enzymes swimming around in the vinegar that make it have such marvelous health benefits.And please don't complain about the taste. This is vinegar; you cannot get around that fact. If you can't stomach the taste, try using the smallest recommended amount (one teaspoon), dilute it in a large cup water or (natural) fruit juice, and just drink it.

They put about 85% FILLER in the bags (dextrose for one, which is sugar!). They do that so a cup of splenda will equal out to a cup of sugar, like BIG DEAL! I want to buy sucralose, not FILLER! Anyhow, I love powdered Drink mix, been using KOOL AID and Whylers UN-Sweetened where instead of adding sugar, I added Splenda. This 2.0 fl oz bottle came in from Amazon and I wanted to give it a try. It says on the bottle that 1 Teaspoon = 2 Cups of Sugar. I always make a Gallon of KoolAid, so that 2 cups equal is perfect! I made it as normal, put in the fridge, oh and I left one full glass of the Splenda version that was from the last pitcher I made. 3 Hours later I try the drink and it's not sweet at all. Very under sweetened. So I added 1 more teasoon to the gallon pitcher, tasted about the same as the splenda brand now. So it's really 2 Teasoons = 2 cups of sugar (or 1 teaspoon = 1 cup of sugar). It says this is = to a 10 LB Bag of sugar on the box the bottle comes in, so it's really half of that. Still, you get 11 cups worth of sugar from this bottle (going by the 5 LB Bag usage), it's still alot cheaper to buy this than the big bag of splenda, the price is about the same, give or take a few dollars for the spenda 9 oz bag, that you only get about 6 cups of sugar tops.I would deff buy this again and will when I run out. Just wish they made this into a larger bottle, I mean like a bottle of Ketchup size, sure it would cost $50, but I'd buy it. This won't last me a real long time and I have never seen this pure Sucralose in stores.I have also been using Stevia of lates, NOW Foods on Amazon sells a huge 1 LB jar of it for $45.

With these I had to restrain myself so I didn't eat too many of the prunes destined for the recipe.I did have a problem with spoilage in a similar product,Made In Nature Organic Apricots, Dried, Unsulfured, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6), which I detailed in that review. The spoilage was obvious by looking at the package (it puffed up like a balloon) and smelling...so I didn't eat anything nasty. To me, an occasional spoiled packet is a fine price to pay for an all-natural preservative-free product; others may disagree which is why I note it here.",5,Best prunes I've ever had in my life,1366243200

You can also bake and make other confections with it, but I recommend that, while you're learning to make the changeover, you use a mixture of agave and sugar until you know how your usual cooking methods will stand up to the change.

They are very attractive, so they also make nice gifts, stocking stuffers, easter basket stuffers, etc.  Even just handing one individually wrapped ball to someone will get a smile and a thanks.The downside is the very high fat content.

This is an even higher saturated fat content than the milk chocolate balls.  The ingredients are white chocolate, vanillin (artificial flavoring), vegetable oil (coconut, palm kernel), sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk, skim milk, soya lecithin and artificial flavors.Also, they melt easily, so you have to be careful about storage (the package recommends 60-68 degrees F).When I eat too many, I do notice an oily texture, perhaps due to the vegetable oil as the third ingredients.

When just one bottle arrived in the mail, all my plans went out the window and I simply opened the bottle and drank it.The water has a slightly bitter taste that is more noticeable if you drink several sips in a row and not so much when you take just one sip. I think it'd probably be less noticeable if you chilled the water first, but mine was warm from the mail carrier's vehicle.The bottle says this water contains ""about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee"", which seems pretty vague to me. I roast my own coffee beans every week, rarely the same origin beans more than once, and they all contain different levels of caffeine and probably significantly more than this water. The small print on the bottom does let you know that there are 90mg of caffeine in the bottle. I had already had my coffee for the day when this arrived and I wondered if the extra 90mg of caffeine would make me jittery or something. I did feel a slight tightness in my chest for a short time after I drank it - kind of reminds me of why I don't take caffeine pills. There's just something about the caffeine in a quality cup of coffee or tea - chemically I guess they have the same components but somehow the extra somethings in coffee & tea seem to make the caffeine less harsh in the body. That's always been my experience, anyway. I don't do well with guarana, either.Speaking of the bottle, it's kind of a funny shape...maybe designed to take up more room on a shelf than 16.9 fl ounces normally would while still being stable in a car cup holder? It also has a solid silver print on the bottom that makes it difficult to see how much liquid is left in the bottle. Maybe not a big deal to some, but I have this THING about knowing exactly how much of something I'm eating or drinking is left.I can't really see myself buying a 12 pack of this from amazon - first of all I already have my daily cup of freshly roasted and ground coffee and the occasional cup of good quality tea, but secondly I'm just not that into the idea of bottled water - I think it's ridiculous to pay for something you get right from your faucet and to get it packaged in a hunk of plastic that will likely just end up in a landfill. Well, most of the time anyway. The time I can see purchasing this is when on a road trip, like driving through the hot, dusty San Joaquin Valley or down to Southern California or coming back from wine country, sleepy after a day of wine tasting and then a too-big dinner. It seems like a good alternative compared to a lot of other beverages you could buy in a convenience store.I'm giving this four stars based on the fact that I can think of a time when I would buy it and that my personal opinion of whether you SHOULD buy water in a bottle isn't necessarily related to the quality of this product as compared to other similar things you might buy.",4,a bottle of water...with caffeine,1340841600

Cooks beautifully in about 20 minutes without stirring or intervention of any kind if you use a double boiler.  Or better yet, load it into a programmable rice cooker the night before. The nutty, chewy texture is essential to the experience, and in that regard, the double boiler approach delivers a somewhat crunchier end result than my rice cooker, which creates a softer, more porridge-like oatmeal, due to the longer presoak and cooking time involved with the night-before approach.The cans keep quite a long time unopened---at least a year or two if the freshness dates are to be believed--- but I find the grains start to taste a littel stale or musty if you keep an open can more than a month or two.",5,"The way oatmeal was meant to be: sensual, not pasty",1172016000

32260,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B00GLP9PY0,Sheri in Reho,"I love iced tea, so I was intrigued by the idea of a liquid that could instantly turn my water into iced tea. I tried the Strawberry Guava variety. I'm not sure I would enjoy it without ice but, with ice, it's fine. That said, it does not taste like flavored iced tea so much as a fruit drink. Generally, with fruit-flavored iced tea, you can still tell it's iced tea, but it has a fruit flavor added. This tastes more like fruit drink without any/much iced tea flavor.The taste is fruity, refreshing and may be too sweet for many folks--this comes from someone who likes her iced tea pretty sweet (using a combination of Equal and Sweet 'n Low). While the few reviews I've read have indicated that this product does NOT have an aftertaste, I would disagree. It absolutely does have an aftertaste to me, but it isn't the most offensive aftertaste I've ever had. I wouldn't want to drink this as my primary beverage, but as an occasional alternative to plain water, it is just fine.The nutrition facts on this product list 1g of Sugars and 1g of Sugar Alcohol. Honey is the first ingredient on the ingredients list, Glycerin is second and Sucralose (Splenda) is eighth. According to my research, Glycerin and Sucralose are both considered Sugar Alcohols. This product contains 0% fruit juice--the fruit flavor is coming from ""natural flavor.""The product comes in a small squeeze bottle that you could carry along to restaurants or to work. The package says it does not require refrigeration but should be used within a month of opening. It contains just under 2 1/2 ounces of liquid flavoring syrup and says it makes up to 24 servings. However, the serving size is a rather gray area. The directions say ""Add one squeeze for every 8 fl. oz. of water."" What you consider a squeeze may not be what I consider a squeeze, but I can say that one of MY squeezes results in a far too watery beverage for my taste. Two squeezes is tasty but a little overboard on the sweetness so, for me, somewhere between 1 1/2 and 2 squeezes does the trick. The product has 10 calories per squeeze.If you are one of the many people who don't like to drink water plain, this may be a great solution for you (as long as you don't have sensitivity to sucralose). HOWEVER, be mindful of the quantity you are drinking, as sugar alcohols can have some unpleasant side effects if consumed in larger doses.I'm a water drinker, but I've been in some restaurants where the water tasted horrible, so this would be a nice emergency standby product for those situations.3.25 stars",3,"Nice fruity taste and great convenience, but has an aftertaste.",1399161600

The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions.

This coffee is much in that style.  Don't expect this to be sweet or creamy, those are the additives you'll need for a latte / cappuccino style coffee you'd find in a typical coffee house.  These, on the other hand, are black coffee with that hint of mint & mocha.  The flavor is great, but not overwhelming.  The addition of a creamer & sweetener can enhance that flavor, but it's up to you to choose what kinds or how much.  The coffee tasted very fresh & not overly bitter, it was a really mild yet smooth flavor.  Personally, I think mint mocha is usually a less common flavor that's only around during the Christmas holiday season, but I'd drink it more often if it was available.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","While nearly all my reviews on Amazon are of Books, Cds and DVDs, I do eat  (and love) peanut butter and so, after I saw this new &#8220;Natural&#8221; version of &#8220;SUPER CHUNK&#8221; on the supermarket shelf today and bought it, I thought I&#8217;d do some research at home and the Amazon listing came up. So I thought I should post a review here. Actually it&#8217;s more an information review, than a product review but I think you&#8217;ll find it informative.Looking at the side-by side jars of the Natural and the regular Skippy there are two differences: One is size. The Natural is an ounce smaller and contains 14 vs 15 &#8220;servinds&#8221;. (Both have 190 calories per serving) . The ingredients are the same in the same order except the regular has &#8220;Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils&#8221; which the Natural has &#8220;Palm Oil&#8221;.  So went  to Wikipedia and found this descriotion of the two oils:Hydrogenated peanut butter contains a small amount of hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are high in saturated fats, thought to be a cause of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke; these oils are added to prevent the peanut oil from separating from the ground peanuts. Peanuts and natural peanut butter, i.e., ground, dry roasted peanuts without added oils, do not contain hydrogenated oils or trans fats. A U.S. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) survey of commercial peanut butters in the U.S. showed that trans fats were undetectable, i.e., below the detection limit of 0.01% of the sample weight.Some commercial peanut butters advertised as &#34;natural&#34; are actually stabilized with palm oil, which provides the same benefit of emulsion.[15][16] But to call this &#34;natural&#34; is a stretch: as former Skippy plant manager Frank Delfino has observed, &#34;That may be natural someplace, but it's not natural in nature.&#34;[17] A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for hydrogenated oils, because palm oil is highly saturated, causing adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.[18][19] A 2011 analysis of 23 countries showed that for each kilogram of palm oil added to the diet annually, there was an increase in ischemic heart disease deaths. The increase was much smaller in high-income countries.[20]Based on this information &#8211; and knowing that there is more danger in the Palm Oil than the Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil &#8211; I returned the two other jars of the Natural version and exchanged for the regular (and actually &#8220;healthier&#8221;) version. As for taste, I didn&#8217;t notice any difference.I&#8217;m really disappointed in Skippy for this &#8220;game&#8221; they are playing, but I guess I&#8217;ll keep buying it; just the one that is &#8220;safer&#8221;I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",2,This NATURAL version is actually unhealthier than the &#8220;regular&#8221; one.

Over the last few years I've found that increasing my fiber intake is a great way of losing weight and maintaining it, so I try to get around 30g a day. Foods high in fiber fill you up more quickly and aid in digestion, The Daily Recommended Value of fiber for adults is 25g per day. Most people in America probably get much less than that, closer to 7-10g a day. At 9g of fiber per serving, just eating one of these bars a day will provide a lot of assistance in meeting the DRV.In addition to the fiber content, the bars really taste great. I've never been a fan of granola-type bars, and figured with a name like ""Fiber One"" these would taste like cardboard, but they are one of the best meal bars I've eaten. They are moist and have a good texture. All of the ingredients seem fresh.At 4g, these bars are very low in saturated fat (they contain poly and monounsaturated fats - the ""good fats).

I suggest a quick trip to the fridge if it's hot outside because the bar was too sticky to get out of the wrapper.  The stickiness and warmth didn't affect the flavor however.

Both.(OK, Review The Product, Not The Principle.)Living and being the cook in a home which has recently gone (or as best I can) gluten free (and not out of a truly clinical health concern) I can say that whatever the reason, I am glad for products such as these. Up until fairly recently, while it was not impossible to find gluten free products, it was nearly so to find ones that could be considered acceptable substitutes.And pasta was high on the list. Early varieties I chose were truly horrid, clearly designed for people who had no choice- shaped correctly, but odd of color; and chewy, with a texture and taste that could in no way be considered acceptable or in some cases even recognizable. And could overpower almost any sauce.I recently discovered a relatively major brand on the grocery store pasta shelf now had a GF spaghetti. I gave it a try and was optimistic. It was not completely the right color, but close, which I considered a good sign. I found the taste and texture to be not a whole lot worse than any other brand of normal boxed pasta that had been sitting on a shelf for years and then served undercooked.I was pleased to see that now Barilla had thrown their capellini into the ring, as it were- despite their personal views on family life in America, they are still considered one of the world&#8217;s major pasta manufacturers. I figured it could be no worse.I cooked a batch of the Barilla, the Ronzoni, and some stale non-GF Barilla I had sitting around. As I expected, they were more or less the same, which is a good thing, I guess. Unfortunately, it was a bit harder to cook the texture on the GF correctly, it seemed to go from a sort of &#8220;al dente&#8221; to &#8220;slime&#8221; a lot more quickly than the non. Seemed to be no matter how it was cooked, to be a little bit more chewy than non GF. Taste? Right out of the pot, it seemed just a bit- off somehow. Not bad, but since I was unable to get it to a familiar consistency, just- off. Next came a bit of olive oil, then later a simple white sauce, and ultimately a full-on Bolognese. And obviously, the deeper the sauce, I would have to say the substitution would unlikely be detected.Do not forget that for the purpose of this review I am pretending that &#8220;real&#8221; pasta does not exist, that you have never enjoyed had the delight of making your own fresh pasta and then using it  to prepare a favorite dish. It goes without saying that anyone who prefers this would not so much as consider using the boxed variety for anything short of a dire emergency, and even then, might just make other plans.The fact that a major manufacturer such as  Barilla has jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon is encouraging. The fact that in most cases, buying into this trend will set you back about 400% more $, is not.",4,"Product, not principle.",1393804800

Of course this can change over time. But at the time of writing this review, it had the best price.Cons:- There is still a mild bitter taste. This is easily mitigated with a pre-wash. If you are still bothered by this I recommend Roland instead. There is absolutely no bitter taste.Small tip on how long to prewash: keep washing until most of the bubbles are gone. The saponin is what gives it the bitter taste and the bubbles when you wash with water.I generally put water in the pot, slosh the quinoa in the pot with my hand, pour off most of the water and repeat until most of the bubbles go away.2 Quick Recipe ideas:1. Cook along with rice in a rice cooker to add a bit of crunch to rice.2.

Bagged teas are usually the lowest quality tea and are mainly a convenience. That's not to say that there aren't exceptions, but after drinking lose leaf green, oolong and black teas, I can really taste the difference now.Newer pyramid pouches have help to improve the quality of single serve teas, but what is in whatever style pouch is still of the utmost importance. In this case, I was impressed. Pu'erh often has an earthy flavor that some might find off-putting, but here I found it mild and to actually be a decent quality tea. The ginger flavored aspect of it is almost unnoticeable, but I do think it adds to the character of the cuppa. I think Numi is one of the better ""mass"" tea purveyors, and with their Ginger Pu'erh Tea Bags, they offer an enjoyable Pu for the masses. It has a somewhat generic flavor, but that isn't a bad thing here. That only mean it might appeal to a broader audience.In the past, those looking to enjoy a cup of Pu would need to buy a brick of it from China, chop off a chunk and shred it, and then seep it according to strict traditional methods. Here, you can get it in boxed, in a bag, and easily steeped in hot water. For me, the best method was to steep it in my large coffee mug with hot water from the company water cooler for about 2 minutes. I then saved the tea bag for another session, this one taking about 4 minutes. It begins to lose it's flavor on the third steeping though is still drinkable (6+ minutes), but by the fourth it is pretty much done.Numi's Ginger Pu'erh Tea Bags are worth trying if you are new to Pu and just want to give it a taste, or if you normally drink it, but want a convenient and portable package for on the road or at work. It can't compare to some of the really good old leaf Pu that you can buy in bulk online, but the price is right for what you get.~ Kort",4,Better Than Expected,1368230400

It is always good to find new varieties and this medium brew is delicious. Surprisingly full-bodied, and although not truly bold, it is close, so if lighter brews are preferred, this might be a little too strong. Of course, economically, additional water can be added to make a larger, weaker cup of coffee.  Out of the box, one of these T-Discs makes an eight ounce cup, and there are fourteen discs per package.Smooth flavor, no strong acidic notes, like the Gevalia that I dislike, and after cooling, I've noticed some brands have an odd aftertaste, but the President's Choice stays true whether hot or cool.

From the product name to its packaging to its touting of the many healthy ingredients used, it looks like it's some sort of wonder health food.

If you're looking for a sweet treat and you're debating between, say, this and a candy bar, I'd definitely urge you to go for this.  However, it's certainly worth noting that this product has a lot of added sugar so, for all its otherwise fairly healthy ingredients, you'd be better off eating some fruit or a slice of whole grain bread with whole fruit spread.However, as a treat, I think these little bites are nice.  I like the crunch and the contrasting textures of the oats and sesame seeds.  The serving size is generous--over 40 bites--but the pieces are small, so you may not be getting as much as you think you are.  Still, because these are so full of contrasting textures, I find that I only need a small amount to satisfy a serious chocolate craving.

5362,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B001EQ51NA,"Patricia ""A Reader""","MR. Z BEEF BRAND PREMIUM BEEF JERKY is the very first beef jerky Ihave ever eaten!  But I've always been curious about this hiking-and-reputed-army-favourite, however, and so I decided to try it.  Hopefullythis review will help others who have never tried beef jerky before..as well as those who have eaten it before.I notice other Amazon reviewers state that it is not as dried out asmost beef jerky is.  I guess it isn't...even I have had meat thatwas more dried out than this beef jerky...and the meat I had wasn'teven beef jerky!  I understand that beef jerky is DEHYDRATED meat,it is dehydrated for the same reason that other food is dehydrated --to make it last longer, (for hiking, etc.), without refrigeration.(The package proudly proclaims: ""NO REFRIGERATION REQUIRED"", near thebottom of the back of package -- but this is presumably for UNOPENEDpackages, ONLY -- because, further up on the back of the package,the instructions, 'AFTER OPENING, REFRIGERATE OR EAT WITHIN THREEDAYS"", are also given.  (Both instructions are on the LEFT side ofthe back of the packet).This semi-soft meat gives much flavour!  I've alwaysliked teriyaki favouring...but have usually found it far, far too salty.Here, the teriyaki is definitely present, and definitely salty...but notas salty as teriyaki sauce. This is probably because, also included inthe ingredienets is ""smoke flavouring""....which is somewhat teriyaki-like in itself, but which has little or no salt, depending on the flavour of the liquid smoke. (The flavour of the liquid smoke is not given here.)  But, I guess when the two are combined, there is less salt then therewould be with teriyaki flavour, only.As in all dehydrated and dried food, the beef jerky is somewhat on the stiff side when first taken out of the package.  Chewing it gives youmore excercise than chewing most other foods!  To this beginner at beefjerky, the energy required to chew it reminds me of chewing a slightly-stiff, new stick of chewing-gum!  Not that difficult, really, once youstart, (at least with MR. Z - brand beef jerky) -- but don't expectthe ease of eating pudding or quiche, fellow first-time beef-jerky eat-ers!  (Is this why they say, ""Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"", I wonder?)So, you get a bit of EXCERCISE along with nutrition here!  Meat alwaysgives nutrition -- and sure enough, 12 grams of protein are listed foreach one ounce serving.  There are 4 servings in each 4 ounce packet.Each serving has 80 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 4% of the RDA of iron.Unfortunately, each serving also has 540 mg of salt!  So, even thoughit's not quite as salty as teriyaki sauce, you defintely can taste thesalt -- and it is a product obviously to be eaten with care, (if eatenat all), by those on low-sodium diets!Also unfortunately -- the ingredients listed, along with beef, water, soy sauce, salt, smoke flavouring, maltodextrin, garlic powder. soybean oil, onion powder, and hydrolyzed (water-induced?) soy protien -- also include, (perhaps inevitably, due to the process involved in making all beef jerky) -- monosodium glutamate, silicon dioxide, glychol propylene, flavouring, (which can be anything, really), erythorbate,sodium nitrate, and caramel colour.  Well, at least sodium nitrAte is used, and not the rumoured-worse-for-the-body sodium nitrIte.)  Still,all these artificial ingredients do give me pause...  Luckily, they are all listed underneath the natural ingredients here, and, as ingredients are to be listed, by US law, in Decending order, that means there are more of the natural ingredients here than the artificial and chemical ones.  As I said, perhaps these artificial and chemical ingredients are necessary because of the dehydrating and curing processes....but still, this is far from organic beef!  It may be considered a necessity for some, when camping and hiking however...and I have devised a little trick, myself, whenever I eat products with too many artificial or chemical ingredients for my taste.  It may not do too much....but Ialways try to DRINK TEA directly after eating, (and if possible,also before eating, such foodstuffs.  This is all my own idea -- I've never heard of anyone else doing this, but it seems to me -- what withtea's reputed anti-oxident and other benefits -- that drinking teaafter eating foods with artificial ingredients at least help somewhatin helping to ameliorate their reputed harmful and deleterious effects. (That is, at least a little, tiny bit...and maybe, perhaps, a bit more...?)  But one still wishes that a more natural curing and dehydratingprocess could be found and/or used.Thoughtfully included in this package is a tiny packet of ""Oxy-Free 504""([...]  The words ""Oxygen Absorber"" are written on the packet as well, which describes the purpose of this ""DO NOT EAT"" enclosure -- which is to keep the meat fresh.  As well as the meat itself, this tiny golden packet can, I think, be refrigerated as well....to be used again when keeping other items fresh, if one wishes.  (But don't use it for too long...tiny air holes in the packet allow the freshener to work, butalso will stop it's usesfullness after a while).All in all, this is a very good product. It is very, very tasty!  And, as far as beef jerky goes, it is not tough at all!  It proudly proclaims, on the front of the packet, that it is made from grain-fed beef, (the best kind!).  Also, that it is 96% fat-free!  (Just looking at the meat pieces within tells you this is true...very, very little fat is visible -- and this is a great thing to see!)  Writing on this packet of beef jerky, (both front and back), proudly proclaims it to be a PRODUCT OF BRAZIL, and it is inspected and passed by the Brazillian Ministry of Agriculture, It has both the signature and seal of the ""Ministerio da Agricultura"" of Brazil printed on the back of package.  It is distributed by IFC, International Foods Company, 6323 NW 99th Avenue, 33138, ([...]) A contact phone number is also given on the packet.This product has a l-o-n-g shelf life.  I received it today, May 28, 2008, and the expiration date is January 23, 2009.  With the prices of meat going up every day, it might be a good idea to buy and keep at least some of this beef jerky in your kitchen, even if you don't go hiking orexploring, or aren't in the army!  And this really does seem to be PREMIUM beef jerky, as the product's name implies.  If you want beefjerky, I believe that MR. Z PREMIUM BEEF JERKY is the brand to buy, (and especially in the teriyaki flavour, for all us teriyaki-flavour lovers!)",4,"TASTY, __NUTRITIOUS, __GIVES__EXCERCISE, __BUT........",1211932800

Coconut is kinda sweet in itself, I have no idea why they load it with sugar.Anyway these flakes are so flavorful. There are a trillion ways you can use them. They are also so fresh.Some people have said in their reviews they are dry... well I suppose that is inevitable because they need to dry the coconut meat in order to preserve it. Also, obviously these will tend to be more dry than those shredded finely because finely shredded flakes will have more surface in contact with moisture from other foods (or your mouth if one eats them alone) and thus will absorb more moisture than large flakes. But it is very easy to shred them more finely with a food processor or similar tools.

However I believe it's the addition of Hibiscus Flowers and Rose Hips to the blend that changes the traditional orange flavors. Because it's such a lightly flavored tea, it's not one that can really be over brewed. It's a good tea for those who like them very mild, almost like flavored water.

My favorite soda is gingerale, and I like all juices apart from mango and blackcurrent.I love lemonade and limeade, and have a wicked sweet tooth when it comes to candy- more gummys and sour things than chocolate. I prefer the taste of diet coke over regular coke, and though I enjoyed them as a kid, things like grape or orange soda make me cringe now. So now you know a little about my taste (in case you relate)- now for the Switch.First, it seems there really isn't any actual sugar in it, which is a nice change. The taste is strong and sweet, but not too overpowering, and the carbonation is just right. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, and will be drinking it again in the future. The can size is smaller than expected- at my house, I have short (old fashioned) and tall (high ball) drinking glasses, and this can filled a highball glass, with no ice (from the fridge).

""JOKI""","I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS. But back to the product at hand- would I order these again? Maybe, but I am more careful about each bean I pop into my mouth now.

I use it as a base for stews and soups, for basting fish before broiling or cooking it en papillote style, and even for adding to salsas and bruschetta to impart an ineffable flavor that never fails to please my guests.You need to be aware of a few potential problems with this sofrito though. First is it contains MSG (monosodium glutamate). If you get a reaction from that then you may want to avoid this particular product. Second, it contains 2565 mg of sodium, which can be a problem for people on a low sodium diet. Finally it contains soy that can cause reactions in some people. These do not necessarily detract from the quality and flavor of this sofrito, but you should be aware of their presence if you or anyone in your family has issues with them.Not only is this an essential ingredient for many Hispanic dishes, it also enhances a lot of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern recipes.

49156,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B0025UCHS6,J. B. Hoyos,"I love baking with Rotini noodles.  They are extremely versatile.  I use them a lot in most of my favorite pasta dishes, especially the simple ones.  They are very easy to prepare and handle.  Because I am a single man who works two jobs, I don't have much time for cooking.  Therefore, I like recipes that are so simple that your pet monkey can be trained to prepare them.I've used many of the other Barilla PLUS noodles already [Barilla Penne Plus, 14.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)andBarilla Thin Spaghetti Plus, 14.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 20)].  The Barilla PLUS Rotini noodles tend to have more flavor and be thicker and coarser in texture than the regular Barilla Rotini [Barilla Rotini, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 16)].  With their additional protein and fiber, they should also be more nutritional.  The extra fiber is great for someone like me who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).Here is the simple meal that I recently cooked for my girlfriend, Tammy.  We both enjoyed it tremendously.Single Man's Pasta Bake1 pound ground turkey meat (or ground chicken or beef)8 oz sliced mushrooms (Green Giant Sliced Mushrooms, 4.5 oz, 12 pk)16 oz box of Barilla pasta, preferably Rotini1 1/4 cup stewed tomatoes, Italian style [Del Monte Stewed Tomatoes Italian Recipe, 14.5-Ounce (Pack of 8)]32 oz pasta sauce, tomato & basil [Classico Pasta Sauce, Tomato and Basil 32 Oz (Pack of 3)]1 cup shredded mozzarella cheeseNote:  Ingredients are approximations.  One may vary them according to availability in your local grocery store.  I've discovered that the boxes of Barilla PLUS noodles are only 14.5 ounces in lieu of the 16 ounces of the regular Barilla noodles.Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Spray a 13"" X 9"" X 2"" baking pan with Pam (Pam Cooking Spray, Baking, 5 oz).  Fry turkey meat in a skillet, drain fat.  Boil noodles according to its package.  Add fried meat and boiled, drained noodles to a pot containing mushrooms, stewed tomatoes and pasta sauce.  Simmer in the pot until thoroughly warm.  Add ingredients of the pot to the baking pan.  Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese and bake for 20 minutes.I also sliced up a couple of green zucchini and yellow squash and steamed them for ten minutes using my OXO Good Grips Silicone Steamer (OXO Good Grips Silicone Steamer, Green).This is a deliciously simple meal that anyone can prepare.
