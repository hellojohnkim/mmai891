paid,Food,"<p>Tirso is a rancher and farmer from Salitre. He has owned his land for over 25 years, but he has lived in the rural area his whole life. Although he has a limited education, he has been able to be successful farming. He is seeking the loan in order to invest in rice now that the rainy season is making the land apt for cultivation. He has five children that he has been able to educate. Two of his children are making their way through college and Tirso wants to keep supporting them. </p>

<p>Tirso is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>



<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>

<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p>

 

<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p>

 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p>

 

 

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Nio occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Anzuelo Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, El Anzuelo Asociacion, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services.  
</p> 
<p>The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><i>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financing, they have turned to loan sharks, paying between 100% and 240% annual interest.  Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and earn fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is a severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,F,825,lender

In San Pedro de Macoris, the employment opportunities are not abundant due to the sugar cane industry collapse and the town's proximity to the capital. (For some industries it's not profitable to establish operations in San Pedro de Macoris, and some people cannot commute to Santo Domingo to work every day due to transportation costs).  

Ramon Concepcion is the group coordinator. He is an electrician and decided to start making power inverters. This generates good profits because power outages are common in the Dominican Republic. Inverters are charged with batteries (the same kind you use in cars), and allow you to run some appliances for a reasonable amount of time. He will use this loan to buy wires and generator parts that are necessary to make inverters. Right now, he works out of his home but his hope is that profits from his sales will allow him to set up his own workshop, and eventually, build a new house of his own.

Claras dream is to help her two sons graduate as professionals from a good school in the large city. </p>

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,F,675,partner

They then sell them when they are faced with an emergency and need money. To supplement his supply, Isaiah usually buys the animals from Myanga Market, Chwele Market, Angurai and Amukura Market.

There, he started a small shop at his home where he sold an assortment of fruits and vegetables. However, he felt that he could do more in order to get a higher income, and that is when he decided to come to Nairobi to build his business. While in Nairobi, he lived with his uncle, and he immediately started off another shop selling potato chips (fries) and bananas. Once this business picked, he left it for his wife to run, and it continues to run today. He often helps his wife in the shop in the evenings before closing for the day.

Fortunately, he had a cousin who owned a metal workshop.  He was able to assist with tasks at the workshop which gave him work exposure. After about 6 months he left and was employed at a firm named  Joaki Enterprises within the city. That was in 2000. Franklin was lucky and got a contract to make windows and doors for Ksh 17,000 (USD 243). With this kind of money, he decided that it was time to be on his own. Through his savings and the money he earned from the contract, Franklin started his own workshop in September 2005. Since then the business has been doing well and has enabled him to put his eldest daughter into a boarding school in Kakamega, the western part of Kenya.
                                    
The only impediment to Franklins business is that he doesnt have a grinder and drilling machine. Quite often he borrows from neighboring workshops, which are sometimes not willing to loan their equipment. Time and money is wasted negotiating for the equipment. Lately he has been losing business due to the lack of machines. 

Therefore Franklin is kindly asking for a loan of USD 200 to enable him to purchase the grinder and drilling machines.

Franklin sees this as a way of creating job opportunities and intends to employ two more people to help him at the workshop.

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

She travels to the city to purchase jewellery, which she then sells to specific clients which are growing by word of mouth among her many friends and satisfied customers. The high value of her wares make it unwise to display her merchandise openly on a street corner, so she operates based on referals and makes house calls.
</p>
<p>This loan will allow her to purchase more of the jewellery she sells, specifically rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings made of silver, pearls and particularly the native Dominican stones of Ambar - shaded in dark orange and brown tint - and Larimar, named after its hues that look like the blue waters of the Caribbean Sea.

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Alex is a native of Salitre, Ecuador, where he has been farming rice his entire life. On his lands, he has rice, cattle and some other fruits such as mangoes. He will use the loan to invest in rice production and to buy a few new steers. He hopes he can continue to improve his lands and increase his property. He has three children. One is still in school. The other two help him out with his cattle ranching and farming. </p>

<p>Alex is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserves for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. The loans will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 

<h4>Risks</h4> 

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p> 

<h4>Loan Use</h4> 

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,F,1200,lender

The residents of the area are engaged primarily in agriculture and animal husbandry.  There are factories that produce candles, hats and industrial machinery, and provide work to anyone who wants a manufacturing job similar to those found in larger cities.  Children spend most of their time inside because of the unevenness of the land and the strong winds that blow all day long.   This group consists of 12 women, all of whom are organized and well-mannered.  They are devoted to different business activities, carried out both within and outside of the home.  Here are some examples:
<p>
<b> Sra. Chocho Illescas Blanca Celestina</b>:  Blanca is 27 years old, married, and has three children (ages 9, 7, and 1).  The two oldest children attend school in the Yanaturo area.  Her husband works in the city as a jeweler.  The communal bank gathers at her house every 15 days for their meetings because she is the group president.  She currently leases her home, but will own it outright in about two months when she completes the payments.  During the week, Blanca spends most of her time on household chores.  On the weekends or whenever people ask her, she prepares food at her customers house or in her own home.  She learned to cook about 10 years ago when she worked at a restaurant called <i> Balcn Cuencano</i>.   Everything she makes is well received because the food is quite tasty.

Blanca is requesting a loan of $440 USD from Fundacin ESPOIR to buy pots, industrial kitchenware, and other materials needed for her work.  Her future goal is to finish her house payments and, at the same time, open a restaurant.

They have four children (ages 15, 10, 8 and 3).  The first three children are students, one in high school and the other two in elementary school.  Cecilia spends her time sewing, which she has been doing for about 4 months.  She is not a professional yet, but is still learning.  Sra. Cecilia works with Sra. Pilar Suqui, who is also a communal bank member, and asked to be part of the group.  Her first loan was very beneficial because she used her $330 to buy a sewing machine and fabric.  Although not yet known for her work, she is learning from Doa Pilar how to make trousers, blouses, dresses, and sportswear.  She needs to purchase lycra fabric, which costs $5.80 per yard.  Her work schedule runs between 8am-12pm and 2pm-5pm.  She also works on the weekends during the morning.  She is able to get much accomplished on the weekends because her husband helps with the household chores.  He works as a company driver and is off on the weekends.  Cecilias goal is to continue learning her craft and open a workshop in her home.

<b> Sra. Illescas Zumba Mara ngeles</b>:  Mara is 55 years old, married and has 12 children between the ages of 10 and 20.  She doesnt remember the exact ages of each of them.  Four of them are in high school, three are in elementary school, and the older ones are working and married.  She lives in a rented house because her family cannot complete the construction on their own.  Her husband is a farmer, and when he is not working, he helps around the house.  She spends her time performing household chores (including washing clothes), raising animals, and cultivating crops.  Starting on Thursdays and through the weekend, she washes clothes for neighbors.  She charges $1 per dozen garments, $0.50 for blankets, and $0.25 for jackets.   Mara is a native of Santa Ana, which is a parish in Cuenca.  She has lived in Yanaturo for 18 years.  She will use her loan of $330 to buy livestock that she will yoke together to plow her fields.  She plans to fight through lifes struggles and hopes to own a house so that she can rest peacefully and not have to worry about the rent each month.

In Nakuru he was accommodated by Odhiambo who hails from the same rural village of Siaya. For six months Otieno looked for a job in Nakuru City without success and because Odhiambo was finding it expensive to feed and provide for Otieno, he advised Otieno to try his hand on a business. Odhiambo earns his living by transporting people on his bicycle (Bicycle Taxi) and utilizes the little income to take care of himself and his sick parents back in the rural area. He leased a bicycle from a fellow trader and introduced Otieno to the business of Bicycle Taxi.
Otieno mastered the business very fast and was soon earning an average of US $ 30 per week after paying for the bicycle leasing. This income supplemented Odhiambos income and the two young men began sharing their cost of living and saving same money to help their parents in rural home. Otieno liked the bicycle taxi business and stopped looking for a job. He decided to concentrate on this business but still enrolled for a computer application course to improve his knowledge.
In year 2005 Otieno received a loan of US $ 100 from Eb-F and utilized the money to purchase his own bicycle. He used the equivalent of the money he was paying to lease a bicycle to service his loan and by March 2006, he had paid his loan on full. This increased his income to US $ 60 per week and has enabled him pay school fees for his younger sister.
Otieno does an average of 16 five kilometers trips per day and at the close of the day he is very exhausted.
Otieno wants to improve his business from Bicycle Taxi to Motor cycle Taxi. This will increase the daily trips to 28 and at the same time reduce exhaustion. He has identified a motor cycle that is selling at US $ 2,375 and he has saved some US $ 375 for the project. He is requesting for a loan of US $ 2,000 to convert to Motor Cycle Taxi. His budget is US $ 2,261 to purchase the motor cycle and pay for insurance and US $ 114 to acquire a riding gear. This will increase his income to an average of US $ 90 per week. Apart from helping his younger siblings attend school, Otieno plans to save the income to purchase another motor cycle. He will lease out his bicycle to improve his income.

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,550,partner

<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>

<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p>

 

<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p>

 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p>

 

 

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Nio occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4>
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. 
</p>
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p>
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4>
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p>
<h4>Rice Farming Baba</h4>
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p>
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p>
<h4>Risks</h4>
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>
<h4>Loan Use</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,825,lender

The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1075,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,550,lender

defaulted,Food,"<p>Joyce Wahu is a 40 year-old widow with 2 children. Apart from her family, she also takes care of two orphans from her sister. She lives on the outskirts of Nairobi in a place called Ruai town.<p>

<p>Joyce is in the business of raising and selling chickens. Early on, she was offered training by Kenchic Limited, a local farm which deals with chicken production in conjunction with KIOF (Kenya Institute of Organic Farming.) After qualifying to raise chickens, she went to seek funds from a merry-go-round womens savings and lending group of which she was a member. She was granted a loan of Ksh. 20,000 from the group to start her business and with these funds managed to purchase chicks, charcoal for heating, a charcoal stove (jiko) and chicken feed.<p>

<p>Despite a few challenges, Joyces business gradually took off. The profits that she made were channeled into loan repayments to the merry-go-round group. Because the merry-goround was not able to fund her with a large amount of capital, she opted to approach an organization known as Kenya ECLOF for more funds. She was granted Ksh 50,000, which she used to expand her poultry business. Joyce built a chicken coop, increased the number of chickens she was raising, and bought feeding equipment, as she had previously fed her chicken using her kitchen wares. Unfortunately, her chicks were struck by avian flu, which was a big blow to her business since she also had a loan to pay and medication to buy for her chickens.<p>

<p>Joyce struggled to pay her loan, but with a lot of determination and hard work she managed to pay back all of her debt and continued raising the few chickens that survived the flu.<p>

<p>Joyce is very proud of her accomplishments as a poultry farmer, and community members recognize the high quality of her chickens. Some even go to her and seek information on how to raise chickens! Joyce gladly offers them training and advice the best way that she can.<p>

<p>Joyce has been unable to expand her poultry business from the current level of 100 chickens to 400 chickens. Through Action Now: Kenya, she is requesting a loan of Ksh 65,000 from Kiva lenders to grow her business. With the loan, she will be able to purchase 400 chickens, buy food and charcoal for heating, which will help boost production and income. Furthermore, she will be in a better position to continue educating community members about poultry nutrition and will offer employment opportunities as her business expands. Finally, she will also be able to take better care of her family. She is thanking Kiva lenders in advance as they assist her in her goals. The repayment period will be 12 months.<p>

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Oscar has two children who live with him and his wife. His lands are an inheritance from his father, who he worked the fields with since he was young. On his lands, he has a section for rice farming and another part dedicated to raising pigs. He is hopeful that with this loan he will be able to work the lands to make them more productive. With his increased income, he hopes he can continue to educate his children.  </p>

<p>Oscar is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

He commercializes the rice and pigs himself by traveling and selling to the nearby city of Milagro. He has one son who is in school. He wants to buy a truck in the future with the extra money he makes. He also hopes he can continue to provide an education for his 15 year old son. </p>
<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

Yolanda Poche Valdez is the group coordinator. She has four children who are all grown up (the youngest is 26 years old). However, they all still live with her and she supports them financially. Her business consists of selling clothing from her house. She purchases clothes in bundles, then sells the clothes, and this activity is what her first loan will be used for. If sales are good, she can sell them all in a month. This bundle will be entirely of childrens clothing, not necessarily because it sells better, but, in Yolandas words, Because these are the clothes I like to sell. She thinks the fact that she dedicates her business to only the clothes she likes to sell will make her business progress.  She hopes in the future to buy and sell bundles with bedding (sheets and towels) as well as clothes for adults. 

Matelo Cauzi is the group two coordinator. He has six children who are all living with him. He sells vegetables in a stand at a local market. He buys his vegetables from a large supplier in the same market and sells them in his small stand.  The vegetables he sells the most are carrots and eggplant. Eggplant is a popular food in Dominican Republic because it doesnt cost much, making it affordable when meat is too expensive.  Also, it serves as a good side dish with rice and beans, which is the traditional Dominican meal. Matelo thinks its important for a stand in a market to look attractive so that customers are drawn to it. He also thinks a seller must be aware of his customers demands because demands vary from person to person.

He has raised 5 children thanks to the help of his rice farming. He is now hoping that he can receive a loan in order to improve his farm and leave his children with more productive lands. He has had 5 children in total and he is happy that they have grown up but still help him on the family's farm.  </p>
<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> Dionicio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

He will work the lands and buy fertilizer for his crops. He lives with his two daughters, a son and his wife in a house near the home of his parents. His goal is to level the lands so that they will be more productive for years to come. He is pictured with our loan officer filling out his loan application.</p>

<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances, they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the rice farmers  lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown.

Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan.

companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,825,lender

Despite the difficult situation, Rosalba wants to get ahead by investing this loan on her parents land. Since she was young she has been living off of the rice production from the farm, and she is now looking to make investments that will help her family keep more profits. She hopes that with the loan she will one day have a home of her own for her and her children, ages 5 and 1. </p>
<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> Rosalba is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,F,1200,lender

Because he only has an elementary education, Carlos wants to provide something more for his 4 year-old son. He relies on the income for his rice farming to feed his family and pay for all the household expenses. He has also been raising cattle for several years as a secondary source of income. </p>


<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4>

 
<p> Carlos is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,925,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,950,lender

He hopes that he will be able to use the money from the loan to rent machinery that will help him prepare his land for the next season. With the extra profit, he wants to repair his home and invest in livestock. </p> 
<p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,825,lender

<p>She is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,F,1200,lender

After surveying the area, Jacinta approached an old lady who had settled in Ole roimen many years ago and whose family owned a big piece of land. The old lady allowed her to put up a semi-permanent room in her farm and to farm a small piece of land for the family food. In 2003 Jacinta initiated the formation of Ole roimen w g. drawing members from the farming community in the area.

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures.

They are in need of capital to purchase the necessary materials to sustain the crop, like fertilizer and pesticides. Holger is not married, nor does he have any children. His short term goal is to make the lands of his family as productive as possible while accumulating some savings. He hopes he can study agronomy in the near future if he has sufficient money and luck. </p>

<p> </p>
<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Holger is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p>

<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,675,lender

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador.

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 

<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 

<h4>Risks</h4> 

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p> 

<h4>Loan Use</h4> 

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures.

She lives about an hour outside the capital, Santo Domingo, and makes a living selling clothes door-to-door. While Tomasa has had this business for six years, its grown since she took out her first loan in December 2007. Since then, Tomasa has paid back two loans and is now taking out her third (exactly twice the amount of her first one!) <P>

One of the greatest benefits of a micro-loan is that it provides Tomasa with the capital she needs to expand her business. While many clothes vendors must travel to the capital two to four times each month to purchase new merchandise, Tomasa only has to make this trip once monthly. This indicates that she has a stable and steady source of income, which allows her to make larger merchandise investments. Since she does not have to make this trip as frequently, she reduces travel costs and also has more time sell the clothes. Since receiving her first loan, Tomasa has expanded her business to reach 12 rather than 6 communities within her city. While this growth is certainly impressive, Tomasa continues to dream and plan; she eventually hopes to own a store.<P>

Tomasas aspirations also reach beyond her business as she has high aspirations for her eight-year-old son. While she wants him to study to become a lawyer, he is not yet convinced and would rather pursue a future as a policeman! <P>

In her free time, Tomasa enjoys reading her Bible and learning about beautician practices and computers.<P>

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Miguel is a farmer in the sector of Salitre. On his farm he cultivates rice and soy beans while also raising cattle. He and his wife work very diligently on the farm in order to feed their two kids who are 8 and 13 years old. His wife also makes cheese and sells milk produced from their cows. Primarily though, they sustain their family with their rice production as most people from the area do. They hope to invest in fertilizer and seeds in order to increase their crop output. </p>

<p>Miguel is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

He is not married nor does he have children, but he is still very close to his parents as they live together and work the lands.  He also works at the local rice processing center.  </p>
<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> Eliceo is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,425,lender

Hato Mayor is one of the provinces with the lowest population in Dominican Republic, and many of its inhabitants are forced to perform their work activities elsewhere, or commute to other provinces to work. This results in an additional burden to their businesses and families, as on many occasions, our clients have to be away from home either for work or to restock their inventory.

<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p>

<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

Dr. Mutiso began a clinic back in his rural home in 1996 using some of his own savings amounting to about Ksh. 70,000 (USD 1000), that he had put aside when he was still employed by the Kenyan government. By 1998, the clinic's business had grown tremendously, so that he had moved locations thrice, in order to accommodate the immense need for medical services. <P>

Unfortunately in 1998, he encountered several difficulties when the landlord where his business was located increased the rent to four times higher; the rent shot from about US$ 570 to US$ 1715. He therefore found that due to this steep increase in overhead, he could no longer manage to pay the workers he had employed, let alone continue with the operations of the clinic. Apart from this, his clinic also suffered tremendously due to non-payment of medical bills, i.e., many patients he had admitted failed to remit payments. To further compound the problem, many of these patients were either relatives or neighbours from his home area, making it more difficult for him to reclaim payments, since culturally, it would seem very insensitive of him. By the year 2001, he had incurred a working loss of Ksh. 1.5 million, (US$ 21,430). This amount has not been paid to date. <P>
	
In addition to these problems, he encountered another issue when he traveled to attend a seminar and was away for three months. Upon his return, he found that his staff had stolen and sold off most of the medical equipment he had acquired, and the clinic had actually been run down.  This was a very difficult experience for him, therefore he decided to close what was remaining of the clinic, and he carried away the little furniture that was left. It is with this furniture that he decided to start off a small clinic within Kayole, an informal settlement within Nairobi. <P>

The Exodus clinic is located in the Kayole area of Nairobi, in the middle of a low-income group of residents. The clinic is formally registered with the Ministry of Health in Kenya. Most of the patients that Dr. Mutiso attends to are mothers and children, together with HIV/AIDS patients. His aim of setting up the clinic was to reach the less privileged in Kenyan society, by providing medical service that is affordable for them. <P>

Dr. Mutiso now intends to set apart a child welfare clinic within his premises, from where he will be in a better position to provide services related to the growth and well-being of children ages five years and below, from the Kayole area. From here he intends to provide vaccinations and health education for the parents, and he will also include family planning services. As an extension, he intends to provide home-based care, that is, door-to-door vaccination services, and generally attempt to raise the awareness of the community concerning the importance of vaccination for children. <P>

Dr. Mutiso is therefore requesting a loan amounting to US$ 950 with which he will be able to partition off a part of the treatment room, in order to create space for the child welfare clinic. The loan will also enable him to purchase furniture for his clinic, acquire an assortment of medical drugs, a scale for babies, surgical forceps and scissors. He will also purchase a small television set that will keep the children busy as they wait to receive treatment.  He intends to repay the loan within a period of 12 months.",Kenya,M,950,partner

<p>
Mary started her business in the year 2000 after getting lessons from her daughter, now aged 24 years, who was trained how to knit using a loom machine by a group of women in Kenya called Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organization. This group teaches women how to get into self-employment using locally available materials. Mary knitted two sets of tablecloths and took them to the offices of Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organization. Fortunately she got buyers and sold the sets of the tablecloths, and earned herself a cheque of Ksh 2000 (USD 29). Mary used this money to buy knitting wool, which she used to make 4 sets of tablecloths. Again she took them to the offices of Maendeleo ya Wanawake and all the 4 sets were bought and by the time she was leaving their offices, she had got orders from a number of people. 
<p>
Marys business has continued to grow and for now she deals with tourists from Switzerland and they love her work very much such that every month she does at least 10 sets of tablecloths for them. Unfortunately, last year, Marys brother who is a drug addict took her money to buy drugs. For now Marys business is doing poorly due to a shortage of money to purchase materials for knitting. 
<p>
Right now Mary has an order to make tablecloths worth Ksh 10,000 (USD 150) but what is drawing her back is the fact that she has no money to buy the materials needed. She has so far not managed to get access to any money to enable her to purchase the needed materials to accomplish her order.
<p>
Mary Wanza therefore requests for a loan of USD 150, which will be given in kind, to enable her purchase materials for knitting the tablecloths. The repayment for this loan will be 8 -14 months. Given this loan Mary will have an increased number of orders to make tablecloths which will generate more income. Mary promises to train at least three people from her community how to knit, and also employ two people to help with the increased workload.",Kenya,F,150,partner

Because Jacquelines husband is the eldest in his family, it is therefore his responsibility to take care of his sister, till she finds a job in order to support herself.
<p>
Ever since she can remember, Jacqueline had been interested in becoming a tailor. To accomplish this, she joined a training class at Redeemed Gospel Church at Huruma in Nairobi for classes and practical training, which lasted for two years. After training, she started her business in 1996 with about US $147, which she borrowed from her sister. She has since paid that off. She started by making petticoats, which she sold from house to house for a period of six months. The business picked up very well, and with this income she built a stall of her own in Kayole, where she could carry out her business more effectively. She later expanded her business and started making clothes and curtains. And she started offering training; at the moment she has three trainees. Jacqueline was doing well, but unfortunately, her stall was broken into and two of her sewing machines were stolen. Because of this, she had to rent two machines for four months, at about $7 per machine per month. This eventually became too much of a burden and made her business shrink, and she even lost customers. Later she moved from Kayole to Kawangware, and with the money she got after recovering from her loss, she bought a sewing machine.
<p>
Jacqueline is now asking for a loan of US $475 to enable her to buy materials and a sewing machine.

defaulted,Agriculture,"<p>Nestor is a native of Baba, Ecuador where he has cultivated rice for nearly his entire life. On his farm he has a few other crops, but rice has always been his staple. He plans to invest in seeds, fertilizer and pesticides in order to make his lands more productive. He lives in his home with this mother and father who are now too old to work with him. </p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4>

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. 

</p>

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4>

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p>

<h4>Rice Farming</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p>

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,675,lender

It is a common saying among people that when the business bug strikes a person there is no turning back. David Maingi is a case in point. In 2004, David took half a sack of beans and another half of maize to Kinanie market. He was able to sell his goods within two hours of his arrival at the market, which gave him the confidence and funds he needed to start his own business. David continued to take his cereals on a bicycle to Kinanie Market each day, until late 2004 when David secured a stall at the market. This was a milestone in Davids life after many days of praying and fasting. David now devotes most of his time to running the stall and his business is doing very well. Recently too, Kinanie has started to expand and the population is growing at an alarming rate, which is an encouraging sign to the people in the business sector. 

Davids stall is a beehive of activity as people scramble to buy his cereals, which are always fairly priced. David now needs to expand his business and is seeking a loan of USD825 to purchase a larger variety of cereals including maize, beans, rice, dried peas, green grams, black eyed peas, etc.  By expanding his range, he believes that he will have enough stock to meet the demands of all his customers, and will no longer have to turn away customers due to lack of stock.

He is the sole provider for his family and this business is the one that has supported his family for over 5 years now. He is married with 4 children.

His business location is in a suburb town within Kisumu city called Muhoroni. There is a sugar factory called Muhoroni Sugar Factory from which he gets his molasses. His business is unique in that there are few people in the area who thought of establishing a business like his. The interruptions that occurred to his business due to the post-election violence slightly affected his supply and necessitated a refinancing. This is the basis for the current loan that he is seeking.

In his group he has a leadership role as the group Chairman. His leadership style is unique in that in addition to being a strong leader, he has devoted part of his time to counseling the group members affected by the post-election violence as a way of ensuring that the group business activities pick up faster. This has endeared him to his group members who view him as a servant leader who is both concerned about their businesses and their social needs. His group leadership qualities have thus ensured that his group is among the most united in the region. Another unique feature of the group that has led to their current cohesion is his highly participative type of leadership which has encouraged members to voice their opinions openly without fear of victimization.

<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>

<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p>

 

<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p>

 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p>

<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property.

He is married and has two wives, one living with him in Kibera, and the other living with his aging mother back in his home village in Busia District, in the Western Province of Kenya. In total Charles has 11 children, two of which with his first wife, now deceased. Three of his children - all daughters - are married, but the other 8 children, together with his wives and his mother all depend on him.

Charles started his hotel in 1999, after he got some savings money from his grocery shop, still in Kibera. He did this in order to diversify his business, and he has continued to run both businesses since. He works together with his wife in this business, and has also employed two employees to assist with the workload. Some of the favorite foods that he serves in his hotel include mandazi (similar to doughnuts), chapatti (a kind of unleavened bread made from wheat flour), beef stew, fish, ugali (A paste made from a mixture of maize meal and water), beans and githeri (made from a mixture of maize and beans boiled together then fried). Charles is a member of the Agape group of Action Now Kenya, within the Kibera slums, and has so far received loans of $57 and $85, which he used to buy stock for his hotel. Charles also received $115 from his group, which he used to buy 2 bags of cement and sand to plaster the walls of the hotel for better presentation. Charles has also been trained by ANK on living with HIV/AIDS, and has learnt about small business management and operation, together with loan management. 

Given the loan of $225, which is repayable within a period of 8  14 months, Charles intends to completely refurbish his hotel by fabricating a new set of chairs and tables which will be designed to save space through the sitting arrangement. This will be the first phase where two tables, with six seats each, will be fabricated. Once the loan is repaid, he intends to borrow an additional loan to make another two tables, to ensure that he has a sitting capacity of 24 people at any one time. Currently his hotel can only sit about 10 customers, yet he feels that there is space to accommodate more people. Through this support, Charles will be assured of additional income, due to the extra business created through the sitting arrangement in the hotel. Charles also hopes that in future as the business continues to expand, his hotel will create additional job opportunities for more people within the Kibera slums. He also intends in future on expanding by buying a television set and video machine, through which to attract more customers, and to also provide some educational information for his customers.",Kenya,M,225,partner

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1075,lender

Jenny is a stylist in her own beauty salon where she cuts hair, colors hair, and gives manicures to her customers.  She has had this business for ten years.  Before, she had a place where she took care of customers.  But, as she is now pregnant, she cannot work as much as before.  The pregnancy has given her a bit of depression, and she has to rest.  Therefore, she has decided to close her place for a while and work from house to house for a while.  This way she will save on the rent of her local, but she will still keep her customer base.

Jenny has asked for a $550 loan, which she will use to pay her daughters school and pay the rent for her house (she rents from her mother).  Her ex husband should pay for their daughters education.  But, he is a little behind in paying support, so it falls to Jenny to pay it. 

Jennys future goal is to buy a small piece of land where she can build her own house.

She has been getting loans from the Fundacin Espoir for one year.  She likes it because it is much easier and they ask for less paperwork than a traditional bank.  They help me a lot, she says.

 <p>In 2002, she received Ksh 15,000 from a womens revolving fund group. She decided to do something productive with this money that would bring in more income and add value to her life. Hannah was motivated by some of her nearby friends who operated a poultry business, and she took Ksh 4000 to purchase 100 chicks at Ksh 40 each. With the remaining Ksh 11,000, she bought chicken feed, medicine and charcoal for keeping the chicks warm because electricity is expensive and charcoal is the most affordable source of heat. This has added value to her life not only by enabling her to take better care of her family, but also by giving her the dignity of having a sustainable career.<p>

<p>Hannah is financially burdened with the demands of supporting her family and educating her children. Because of this, she has been unable to expand her poultry business due to a lack of funds. Hannah now understands that in order to expand her business, she needs to add a total of 300 more chicks at a cost of Ksh 15,000, 20 bags of feed at a cost of Ksh 35,000, and chicken medicine and charcoal totaling Ksh 15,000. With a loan of Ksh 65,000, Hannah can add tremendous value to her business, family and community by ensuring the availability of high-quality healthy products that will generate increased income as well. She will also educate community members on how they can start raising chickens as a sustainable livelihood. Her repayment period will be 12 months.<p>

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  

</p> 

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 

<h4>Risks</h4> 

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p> 

<h4>Loan Use</h4> 

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,550,lender

He has four children, only one of which is still in school. His other three children live and work with him on his farm and help him produce rice. He wants to improve his home, because it is made only out of wood at the moment. </p>

<p>Juan is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. The loans will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

Ercilia is a member of the Mujeres Unidas (United Women) Communal Bank, a large group of women that meets every two weeks at the ESPOIR office in Jipijapa, a small town on the Ecuadorian coast.  She is a lovely and friendly woman who enjoys talking with people.  Sra. Ercilia is in a common law marriage and the mother of 2 children.  Unfortunately, her daughter died at the age of 16.  Her son is finishing his high school education at the moment and hopes to continue his studies and become a doctor someday.  She is looking at the possibility of sending him to medical school in Guayaquil.  Her husband is a technician who spends his time repairing computers, televisions and radios.  Lately, he has not had much business due to a lack of customers.  
<p>
Sra. Ercilia sells shoes door-to-door.  She sells womens shoes from a catalog called El Cleo, and her customers place their orders and pay with cash or on credit.  She started her business 13 years ago with the help of a loan from Fundacin Espoir.  Sra. Ercilia still remembers that her first loan was in the amount of 130 sucres (Ecuador was still using another currency at the time and had not started using the US dollar).  Her customers are municipal workers, hospital employees, and teachers.  She leaves home every day to take orders and collect payments.  Already she has gained considerable business experience, knowing which clients to grant credit and which ones to refuse.   As a saleswoman, she says it is better to sell door-to-door rather than from a fixed location because she can go find her clients and collect from them rather than sit in one place all day.  She has around 30 regular clients and sells about 2 dozen pairs of shoes each month.  Her customers would also request American brand shoes, which she would have shipped to her in a suitcase.  However, that did not prove to be profitable, so she prefers to sell through the catalog.  
<p>
Sra. Ercilia will use her loan to buy more shoes to offer to her clients.  She enjoys working because she likes having her own income, which she uses to buy clothes for herself and her son also.  Her dream for the future is to open a <i>cevichera</i> in Guayaquil.  If her son ends up going to medical school there, then she could visit him all the time and do his laundry.  Therefore, it would be a good idea to open a business there as well.

 <h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4>

<p> He is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that it is imperative for the communities it works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </i></p>

<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p>

<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water from the nearby river.  </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,825,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4>
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. 
</p>
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p>

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4>
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p>
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p>
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p>
<h4>Risks</h4>
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>
<h4>Loan Use</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures.

For the past few years, she has had to take become the mainstay of the family's economic survival, as her husband hasn't had a steady job for quite some time! Occasionally he works as a hired hand in agricultural duties (the area has a lot of cocoa farming, and there's a need for laborers at the time of hand-picking of this precious fruit! He now works assisting her in her clothing sales, by delivering the goods and doing some collections himself! 

The clothing Antonia sells comes from pacas (or packs of pressed new and used clothing which Dominicans can buy from donations to the poor on the Haitian side of the island, which the people bring over to the Dominican Republic in order to sell them and thus, be able buy food and groceries). Pacas come in at least three types: Type A, B and C. Type A packs are mostly of premium goods, as they contain new items, often from signature brands, and which command a premium price, for obvious reasons. On type As (worth between USD$300 to $400) there is more income to be made, as they can be sold to a higher income bracket customer. However, Antonia tells us thus far she has only been able to buy type B pacas (worth some USD$250 to $300 mainly dependent upon the composition and proportion of the new/used portions of clothing to be found on them) which is obviously of a lower quality from those on the type A group. Finally the type C pacas (costing anywhere from USD$100 to $250, each) are the cheapest, obviously consisting of used clothing or new of lower quality. Paca buyers must trust their intermediaries, as the insides are not able to be seen until the packs are opened. Normally the pacas are opened and sold on a piece by piece fashion, which will bring the largest return on the sales. However, those go to the Haiti-Dominican Rep. border in order to buy the pacas, as Antonia does, can buy them at lower prices than those that might be found in or near the cities, such as Santo Domingo. The trip to the border costs somewhere in the neighborhood of USD$25-30 each way, expensive, but theres no other way Of course, both the sacrifice as well as the cost is recuperated a few times over, once the paca buyer has been able to do the purchasing and transportation to the end markets territory. The unopened pacas can command up to three times the value over their original cost once brought into the final market areas, as the owner/buyer is able to maintain the quality standards customary to their customers. But most prefer to have the larger income product, which may be brought in selling them piecemeal! 

Antonia wishes to be able to have her kids grow, become good citizens and show their love for the country! This she plans making via sufficient income in order to be able to pay for their transportation, and daily needs with school. Shes never had a type A pack, as shes only been able to pay for a maximum of the Bs value.

<p>From an early age, Mary wanted to be a dressmaker. When she became a young woman, she approached some well-known dressmakers in her neighborhood and asked for training. One of her friends offered her this opportunity, and after her training period Mary became a skilled seamstress. Shortly thereafter, Mary started her own business with an initial capital of Ksh. 5,000 that she received from a merry-go-round savings and lending group. With this money, she purchased a sewing machine and some materials to start off with. Since she did not have enough money to rent a proper stall, she worked from her house. Her business continued to grow and with her earnings she managed to move her business out of her house and into a rented public stall alongside other popular businesses. This site was very good for her since it was in an active shopping area, and because of this, she began attracting more customers. As her business continues to grow, Mary wants to expand even more but she doesnt have access to the necessary funds. With a loan, she wants to purchase a sewing machine and increase her stock of materials. Thus, Mary is requesting a loan of Ksh 15,000 that will enable her to acquire these items and keep her business growing.<p>

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,425,lender

He hopes to invest the loan in buying seeds, fertilizer and pesticides for the upcoming planting season. His goal afterwards is to make some improvements to his home.</p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4>

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. 

</p>

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4>

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p>

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,550,lender

Nicholas has a standard eight education (Primary Level) but is keen to see his siblings get quality education, something he was not able to get because his parents could not afford the school fees.

The poor conditions from his home area in Western Province drove Nicholas to come to the city of Nairobi and live with his uncle in Kibera at an early age of 14 years. It was during that period that Nicholas went through vocational training in shoe making at the Makina market within Kibera slums through support from his uncle. His uncle paid $ 65 over a period of eight months where he was attached to a shoemaker and was learning through apprenticeship. He continued to get the shoe making skills for two years (1992 to 1994) without a pay even after the eight months period of learning had elapsed.

Nicholas has now been involved in the business of mending shoes for now 12 years, and he is proud of his work. This is because he is making a difference in someones life.

He has been farming rice since he was a young man since he did not finish school and only had the skills passed down by his father to rely on. With his work he has provided for five children, three of which are still in school (ages 7, 10 and 15). With the loan he hopes to make an investment in seeds and fertilizer to reap more from his lands. Jesus hopes to make some improvements in his home with the extra profits, as well as secure the education for his children. </p>
<<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> Jesus is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

They own a small number of cows and bulls, as well as chickens and other livestock. Like most people in the area, they depend on rice farming for their income. </p>

<p>Wilman is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>


<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>



<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>

<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor, especially the roads and water services.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p>

 

<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p>

 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p>

 

 

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Nio occurs, the rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Audencio is a rice farmer from the Santa Lucia province. He has been farming rice and raising cattle for about 50 years since he was young. He and his wife Germania have been living on this farm since they were married. They have raised their two kids and fed their family thanks to the fertility of their lands. Their children are all grown up now, but Audencio continues to cultivate rice in order to feed himself and provide additional support to his sons. </p>

<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,925,lender

<p>
From 1986 - 1997 Rose worked at Image Salon in Nairobi.  She decided to leave Image Salon and start her own business because of her poor salary (Ksh 3000, USD 44 per month), which was not enough to sustain herself and her family.  With the initial capital of Ksh 10,000 (USD 147), which she got from a merry-go-round group, she rented a stall for Ksh 700 (USD 10). With the the rest of the capital she bought a second-hand blow dryer, two chairs, and chemicals.
<p>
Rose's business has continued to grow and Rose recognizes that the demand for her services is stronger than she can provide as a single business owner (customers flock to her stall because of her expertise in applying chemicals and also plaiting). Rose wants to retain her clients, and therefore asks for a loan of Ksh 7500 (USD 125).  With this loan she will be able to purchase 5 chairs and a blow dryer. This will greatly improve her service to her clients since the current equipment is prone to breaking down.  Also, the purchase of chairs will allow her clients to sit while they wait, which will match the customer-friendly atmosphere she wants to create.  Rose is looking forward to creating a salon that allows her clients to be comfortable as they wait for her popular services.

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  

</p> 

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 

<h4>Risks</h4> 

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p> 

<h4>Loan Use</h4> 

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,950,lender

He hopes to continue supporting his daughter and growing his business. </p> 

<p>Fernando is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas. known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy). with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

He has had two children, both of whom are grown up and independent. He lives on his farm with his wife and together they make ends meet through rice production. He hopes he can invest the loan by acquiring fertilizers that will help his crops grow better. </p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4>

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. 

</p>

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4>

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p>

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1075,lender

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Tomas Segura is a farmer from a rural town outside of the big city of Guayaquil named Salitre. Tomas and his wife Hortencia have lived on these lands for over 30 years. There they have raised three children who are all on their own now. Tomas is seeking to receive a loan so that hey may invest in rice farming. The rainy season is just coming to an end and this is a particularly good time to plant the rice seeds and prepare the lands. The loan will help Tomas avoid borrowing from the loan sharks common to the area. Although he knows they charge exuberant interest rates, Tomas has been forced to borrow from these lenders several times due to his shortage of capital.  </p>

<p>He is the latest addition to the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

Having received his first loan of $200.00 from Kiva lenders in May 2007, Franklin was able to purchase a grinder and a drilling machine that have greatly boosted his welding business and increased his income. Franklin has since paid back his loan and ANK can testify that its proud to have such a committed client. He paid his loan within a period of 11 months as he had indicated and he admits that the loan really boosted his business. He is also very grateful that the Kiva lenders greatly assisted him to develop his business.</p>

His business has since grown due to his hard work and determination and also because of the timely service he gives his customers. He always ensures that he gives his customers what they request and also offers them reasonable prices for the products he makes. He has continued to win many hearts and hence customer demand keeps on increasing.</p>

Franklin is therefore requesting the Kiva lenders to grant him a loan of Ksh. 30,000 to purchase the machine.

He believes that he will be able to save more when he gets his own machine, and hence he will be able to better take care of his children and their education.

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Jorge has a farm in Santa Lucia, Ecuador. He plants rice and also raises pigs. He has been living on the lands for about 30 years. He primarily relies on rice to feed his wife and two kids, aged 15 and 9. Whenever he is in need of extra capital he goes and sells some pigs in the local market. This has been a great fallback for him and his family. He plans to use most of the money from the loan in rice production. He will purchase pesticides and invest in machinery to help in the collection process. </p>
<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> Jorge is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,925,partner

He likes to have a variety of products because it allows him to be more flexible when selling and it also accounts for bad weather. He hopes to invest his loan in fertilizer and pesticides. He has six children, three who are still in school and live at home. He hopes he can fix his home by making it out of cement or bricks. </p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Progresista Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, La Asociacion Montubia Progresista, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Specifically, they help farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Montubia Progresista have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of La Asociacion Montubia Progresista de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1075,lender

She lives in Pipeline in Nairobi. Gladwell used to work at Export Processing Zones (EPZ) in Pipeline, where she worked as a casual laborer. Her work was to do the finishing on already sewn clothes, like hemming and fixing buttons. However, Gladwell was determined to have her own business and with the money that she had saved from her earnings, she went for training as a dressmaker. The training was offered at a reasonable price by a well-known dressmaker in her area. She attended training in the evenings after work at EPZ.</p>

<p>After becoming equipped with the necessary skills, she quit her job at EPZ and opened her own business with 39,000 Kenyan Shillings she had saved. She bought a sewing machine and cloth materials to start off. The business has been going well but Gladwell has had one problem. She doesnt have an embroidery machine and when she has embroideries to make she must look for someone who can help her for a fee. This has been expensive as well as time consuming. She may find that the owner of the machine is using it and at some point those people who own the machine do not want to lend to someone else.</p>

<p>Gladwell now wants to have her own machine and this is of great importance to her because it will enable her to save time and money. Apart from the machine, she also wants to purchase cloth materials in order to increase her stock.

She is president of the Communal Bank, has raised livestock for 10 years, and attends livestock markets on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays in different parts of the province. She says that the business is profitable and almost never loses money.  When the fair goes badly her only returns are the original capital, but in general she earns approximately $30-40 per head of cattle. When she cannot sell the cattle above a losing price she brings them back home so that she can sell them at a profit next week. <p>

She has been a partner for quite a while. She is asking for a loan of $1100 to invest in the business. Each head of cattle costs about $250 to $300. The only drawback of the loan is that interest has to be paid and seems high, so her goal is to develop her own capital to invest so that she will not have to pay interest.

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default.

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group.

Although he does not have much land, it is enough to make ends meet for his family. Segundo also brings in money by raising pigs. He travels to local markets to sell the livestock when ever he is in need of extra money.</p>
<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> Segundo is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,675,lender

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,675,lender

His oldest son works with him on the farm to grow their products, while the other three still go to school. He is a native of Salitre and has been raised in agriculture his entire life. He also has a small butcher shop in the small town of Salitre. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to invest in feed for his cattle and possibly buy some more steers. With the profits he will continue to educate his kids and feed his family.</p>

<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

defaulted,Food,"Samuel is 54 years old and is married with eight children. He lives in the Kasarani part of Nairobi in an area called Mwiki. Samuel has no other dependents.

Samuel deals with livestock farming, raising both dairy and beef cattle. He started his business in 1997 when he purchased 2 dairy cattle. Samuel learned livestock raising skills in 1993 when he lived in the North Rift Valley of Kenya and purchased a small farm. He later shifted his market to a co-operative distributor in Nairobi. Unfortunately, this venture collapsed and left Samuel and other farmers without a ready market for their product. In 1997, Samuel bought land in Nairobi and took up farming, since he could not bring his cattle with him. Shortly thereafter, he sold his farm for Ksh 38,000 and purchased 2 cows at a cost of Ksh 15,000 each. With the remaining money he bought dairy feed for the animals and was able to start his new life and educate his children. Since he channels all of his revenue into his family and childrens education, Samuel has been unable to increase the number of cows he can raise.

The time has now come to expand his business and increase his profit potential. Samuel is therefore asking Kiva lenders to grant him a loan of Ksh 70,000 with which he will be able to construct a good shed for his livestock and purchase 2 additional cows at a cost of Ksh 25,000 each. This will help him expand his market as the demand for milk is very high in Mwiki. By scaling up his business, Samuel will raise his familys standard of living and better provide for the education of his children. The repayment period of Samuels loan will be 12 months.

Hector makes candy. He makes several kinds of staple Dominican sweets, which have milk, coconut, and peanuts usually. They are sweetened with sugar and enhanced with spices like cinnamon and cloves for a more distinctive flavor. Hector's hopes are to make his business into a candy factory where he can hire staff to make the candy and move forward to a more administrative position.

Jackelin, on the other hand, has a colmado: a small convenience store where she sells the daily meal items. She will use this loan to buy canned goods like beans and sardines.

He is now nine years old.<P>

Margaret Nyabuto started the Tender Feet Children's Center in the year 1993 with only 23 children, in a small rented house. She targeted and supported children that were mostly orphaned, or their parents were prison convicts and they were being supported by neighbours or guardians, while many other were from very poor backgrounds. She would offer basic education to the children from the ages of 5 to 7 and would try to fit them all by grouping them in different corners of the room. <P>Due to the popularity of the center with parents and guardians in the neighborhood over the years, Wanjiku can now boast of a population of 180 pupils with their own school (not the rented one) since Wanjiku bought a plot and built two classes.

paid,Agriculture,"<p>Olfio Alvarado is a farmer from a rural town named Salitre. He is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but it is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.
<p>Olfio, has been farming for most of his life. He was born and raised in the rural sector and has been making a living out of agricultural production since he was old enough to work. He, his wife and their children all play a vital role in the farm. He mainly produces rice, but he also has cattle as a secondary source of production. He is optimistic about the potential use of this loan.
 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>



<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>

<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. 
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks. 

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.

<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Nio occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

William and his family also raise pigs on their farm, only selling them when they are in need of money. William has his rice processed and commercialized at his associations facilities. </p>

<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> 
<p> He is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> 
<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> 
<h4>Loan Use</h4> 
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

She has two children and two grand-children, who all depend on her, because her children are only able to get casual jobs once in a while. Jane sells cooked foods, within the Kiambiu slums, including beans, black beans and githeri, a mixture of maize and beans boiled together.

Jane previously had an embroidery business which collapsed after one of her sons was involved in a road accident, where she spent all she had including business money on his medical expenses. This son eventually died, leaving Jane and her other children absolutely poor. Jane had previously borrowed some money from one of the big Micro-finance institutions in Kenya, to enable her to run this business. Due to the medical problem in the family, she was unable to continue with the loan repayments, hence could not borrow again, since she was now viewed as a risky client.  

Jane started off her current business in early 2006, after she borrowed a tin of beans from a businessman, who allowed her to cook and sell the beans, then later make the payments for the borrowed tin of beans.  From the same proceeds, she managed to buy her first tin of beans, which she continued to cook, hence setting up the business. Jane is now a member of the Vumilia group of Action Now Kenya, in the Kiambiu slums, where she has so far accessed two levels of loans, of Usd. 57 and Usd. 85, both of which she used to increase her stock, and which she has since repaid successfully. 

Currently Jane has only one sufuria (cooking pot) of her own, while the other two she has are borrowed, and the owner has actually been asking her to return them. Jane therefore seeks to buy two sufurias of a bigger size than what she is currently using, together with two jikos (cooking stoves) big enough for the pots she will buy. The biggest benefit to Jane will be that she will be able to return the borrowed pots, and also acquire bigger pots that will enable her to make more food, as is required by her customers. She also intends to introduce the sale of boiled green maize (corn) and green grams, which her customers have been requesting her to make.

As part of goodwill, Jane reserves the bean stock she gets from the boiled beans and githeri, to give to some of the women within the Kiambiu slums, who are too poor to buy food. They use this stock to make a stew for the family meal, hence their children dont have to sleep hungry as long as Jane is there. 

A loan of $75 which will be given to her in kind (i.e ANK will purchase the two pots and cooking stoves for her), will assist her not only to achieve her objective of preparing more food, but will also enable her to have more stock to serve to more people in need.

His two children are already grown up but they work with him on his farm. He is no longer married but is still widely considered as a family man because of the relantionship he maintains with his kids and their children. He will use part of the money from this loan for rice cultivation and the other part to maintain his cattle. </p>

<p>Colon is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount that is missing. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage saving among the group. Promoting saving is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 

<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>



<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>

<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p>

 

<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p>

 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p>

 

 

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p>

 

<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  

</p> 

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 

<h4>Rice Farming</h4> 

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 

<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 

<h4>Risks</h4> 

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p> 

<h4>Loan Use</h4> 

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

He started selling second-hand clothes from one of the biggest second-hand markets in Kenya named Gikomba Market. He acquired a stall and started with 3 bales of clothes.

Apart from his family, Mutinda also assists his elderly father by paying school fees for his twin brothers, who are 16 years old and in secondary school.  He has also taken in his 10 year old nephew after his sister - his nephew's mother - passed away in the year 2000.

After finishing his secondary school education in the year 1994, and not being able to find employment, Mutinda decided to engage into brick making.  Since this work did not require any capital to begin, all he needed to do was learn the skills of brick making.  After learning the basic skills, Mutinda made 5,000 pieces of bricks, which he sold for Ksh 5 per piece.  He earned a total of Ksh 25,000 (USD $368).  From this, he gave his wife Ksh 5,000 for household use, and the rest he saved.  He then made another 5,000 pieces of bricks, which again he sold for Ksh 25,000.  He saved all of this, totaling savings of Ksh 45,000 (USD $662).  With this as his initial capital, Mutinda bought an assortment of goods like spoons, shoes, pencils, books, small transistor radios, shoe polish, plastic plates, sufurias, etc.  He was using a bicycle to sell his wares.

Then, in the year 1996, Mutinda rented a stall in the town of Kitengela, on the outskirts of Nairobi.  The business was doing well, but due to stiff competition from neighbors, he opted to leave Kitengela and decided to try his luck in a neighboring, upcoming town by the name of Mlolongo.  Luck was on his side and he rented a stall, expanding his business by adding TVs, DVDs, and radios.  The business is doing well and Mutinda is still operating from this stall.

Due to the increasing population in Mlolongo, Mutinda wants to add to his inventory so that he can meet the demands of his customers.  He approached one leading micro-finance bank for a loan, but due to the high interest he opted not to take the loan.  Since then, he heard about Action Now Kenya partnering with Kiva, and also saw some of the clients who have benefited from Kiva loans.  Their businesses are flourishing, so Mutinda decided to come to Action Now Kenya to try his luck.
 Mutinda, therefore, requests a loan of $1,175.  With this loan, Mutinda will be able to purchase TVs, radios, dvds, vcd players, vcd discs, and cassettes.  This will greatly improve his business, translating into more income.  Mutinda plans to employ a helper to assist him in the day-to-day operations of the business, and intends to repay the loan within 10 months.",Kenya,M,1175,partner

<p>With the initial capital, John purchased stock for a mini-shop, including items like margarine, flour, sugar, salt, milk, bread, juice, snacks, candies, and cereals such as maize (corn), beans, green grams, rice, etc. Fortunately he did not have to pay rent for the shop because the building belongs to his father and allowed him to operate free of charge. Because of his fathers good will, John was able to stock his shop with goods and also purchase a scale, which is handy in any shop for weighing of items like sugar and cereals.

<p>The business has continued to grow over the last two years and the number of customers has increased as well -- so has the demand for new products like fresh meat, vegetables and dairy products.

With the extra profits she hopes she can purchase a cow and continue to provide her kids with an eduction. </p>
<p>She is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

 
<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>
<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>

<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>


<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>
<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. </p> 
  
<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> 
  
<h4>Access to Credit</h4>
<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> 
  
  
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> 
  
<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Nio occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>",Ecuador,F,1200,lender

Although his children are all grown up, they all work the fields together in order to make ends meet for the family. On his farm Ramon also raises plantain trees and a few other secondary crops. </p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4>

<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. 

</p>

<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p>

<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Baba</h4>

<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. </p>

<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Baba</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.

Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p>

<h4>Risks</h4>

<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1075,lender

He hopes that in the near future he will be able to make his land be more efficient so he can build his family.</p>

<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Freddy is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>

<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p>

<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p>

<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p>

<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4>

<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p>

<h4>Access to Credit</h4>

<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  </p>

<h4>Loan Use</h4>

<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>",Ecuador,M,1200,lender

He travels into Guayaquil (the larger city) to buy their clothing from wholesalers at reasonable prices. He is hoping to invest the loan in buying more products so he can offer better variety at cheaper prices. </p>
<h4>Communal Banking in Baba</h4> 
<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  
</p> 
<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> 
<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> 
<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> 
<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  
companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>
<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  
as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> 
<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> 
<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> 
<h4>Access to Credit</h4> 
<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. 
Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> 
<h4>Risks</h4> 
<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province Los Rios (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p>",Ecuador,M,825,lender
